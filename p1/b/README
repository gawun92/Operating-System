Description
This program is about encrypted network communication
There are two sections 
  1. connecting between client and server with matched portnumber
     Similar to the lab1a but only difference is the way of communication.
     by adding the command --log=filename,
     user can save all recognized data into the communication after connecting.
  2. It is ecrypt. The stpes of Encrypt are divided as the following
     (creating)  - (module open) - (initializing) - (deinitialize and closing)
     in the spec, it is recommended to use "cfb". However, when I tried it for testing before.
     It did not work so I ended up using "ofb" and "blowfish" algorithm.
